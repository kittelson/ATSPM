        <h1>Automated Traffic Signal Performance Measures</h1>
        <p class="lead">ATSPM's show real-time and historical functionality at signalized intersections. This allows traffic engineers to directly measure what previously could only be estimated and modeled.</p>

            <p>Updated the following libraries:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>New "Timing and Actuation" metric that provides a detailed view of the vehicle and pedestrian cycles for each phase overlaid with vehicle and pedestrian actuations. </li>
                <li>Changed the "Pedestrian Delay" metric and replaced event code 45 with event code 90 and some logic so it works  for all controller vendors.</li>
                <li>Integrated Intelight's pull request that adds an async version of GetMAXTIME records that is more tolerant of slower network and DB servers.</li>
                <li>Added support for Econolite EOS Controllers.</li>
                <li>Repaired Aggregate Data</li>
                <li>Fixed several bugs</li>
